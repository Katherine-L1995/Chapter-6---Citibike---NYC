**Summary of Task 3.3: Geospatial Analysis with Folium and JSON**

In this task, I conducted a geospatial analysis using the Folium library for map visualization and JSON data formats for location-based information. Here are the key steps I followed:

Library Installation: I installed the necessary libraries—Folium and JSON—using Anaconda (via the terminal for Mac users or the Anaconda prompt for Windows users). Alternatively, I used the pip command for installation in the command line or terminal, depending on the operating system.

Creating the Jupyter Notebook: I created a new Jupyter notebook dedicated to performing the geospatial analysis for this task. The notebook was set up for importing and analyzing location-based data with the Latitidude and Longitute information from my project CSV to locate the exact location of each bike station across the city. 

Importing Libraries: I imported the required libraries, such as Folium, to visualize geospatial data on interactive maps. I also imported JSON to handle and manipulate location data in the correct format.

Finding a Suitable JSON/GeoJSON File: I sourced a GeoJSON or JSON file containing location data that aligned with my project which included a geopspacial layout of the new york city area specifically. 

Wrangling and Cleaning the Data: I performed data wrangling on my dataset to ensure it met the needs of the analysis. 

Creating a Choropleth Map: I created a Choropleth map using Folium to visualize a chosen variable. This map used color gradients to represent the data, allowing for a clear visual interpretation of trends and patterns across geographic locations.

The outcome of this task was a clean, visual, and interactive map, showcasing the geospatial distribution of the most visited Citibike stations across the New York City area which is more visually informatitive to the viewer.
