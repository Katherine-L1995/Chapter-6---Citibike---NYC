# Chapter-6---Citibike---NYC

## CitiBike Data Analysis Project
#Overview

This project analyzes CitiBike trip data from New York City to uncover insights into rider demographics, usage trends, and trip patterns. The analysis was performed as part of my data analytics certification course and showcases skills in Python, data cleaning, visualization, and advanced analytics.

The final results are presented through an interactive Tableau Storyboard, highlighting key findings, geospatial insights, and advanced analyses.
