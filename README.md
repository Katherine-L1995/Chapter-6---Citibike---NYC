**6.2 - Outline**

Set up a Jupyter notebook with visualization libraries includeding pandas, seborn, and matplotlib.pyplot, and import the cleaned data set for Citibike.
**Citibike - Heat Map**
Create a correlation matrix heatmap (colored). - Where the Map represents the relationship between the hour of the day and day of the week. 

**Scatter Plot: Trip Duartion (minutes) vs Time of Day**

Created a scatterplot that compares the Trip Duration by Hour of Day and Start Hour.
 This scatter plot reveals a slight trend between rider age and trip duration. Riders born in the 1990s show a moderate tendency for longer trip durations, suggesting a potential relationship between younger age groups and trip length. In contrast, older riders appear to take shorter trips on average. While the relationship isnâ€™t very strong, it hints that younger riders may be more likely to take extended trips compared to older riders.

 Create a Box and Whiskey Chart - Examining trip duration by day of the week shows a stronger tendency for longer bike rides on weekends compared to weekdays. This suggests that CitiBikes are primarily used for recreational purposes on weekends, rather than for weekday commuting across NYC. For this project, it would be beneficial to focus on weekend usage patterns to understand how and where bikes are utilized for leisure activities.

 **Revisiting the Hypothesis Questions in 6.1:**

Hypothesis to further explore: Station-Based Hypothesis: Trips starting or ending in recreational zones will have longer durations on weekends than those starting or ending in business or commuter-heavy areas.
